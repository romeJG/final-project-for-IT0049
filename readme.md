<h2>PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS AND DETAILS:	</h2>
	
Mr. Garick Ollivander, the owner of the Ollivander's Wands located in Diagon Alley, London, has requested you to create a web application for his wand shop. This web application needs to have the following:

- A customer registration form that has the following fields: last name, first name, gender, address, birthday, cell number, email (which also serves as the username), and password.
- A customer information page where the user can edit and delete/deactivate their account.
- A product page that displays all the products sold by the shop (specifically wands used by wizards and witches).
- The capability or add items to the customer cart and the ability to check their carts out. (The payment will just be a mock-up, it will be saved in the database but will not have any form of payment acceptance)
- An admin page that can edit, add, archive, and update products displayed in the page.
- An admin page that can view and deactivate customers.
- A transactions page, which can be accessed by the admin only, that can display all the transactions of the shop.
- An about page that displays the information about the shop, the owner, and the developers of the application
